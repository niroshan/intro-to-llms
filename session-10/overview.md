# Session 10 — Start the Report (Explain What You Built)

## Goal
Start a clear, beginner-friendly report/blog post describing the project and what was learned so far.

## Time
~1 hour

## Key Ideas
- The report is part of the deliverable: it proves understanding.
- Write for a smart non-expert (future you, a teacher, or a recruiter).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, the student can:
- Outline the report structure.
- Write the introduction + 2–3 key sections.
- Include at least one generated text sample and explain what it shows.

## Agenda (Suggested)
1. Create an outline:
   - intro (what is an LM)
   - bigrams
   - neural next-word
   - RNN/LSTM
   - attention/Transformers
   - conclusion
2. Collect evidence: screenshots, sample outputs, loss curves if available.
3. Draft the introduction and early sections.
4. Add a “What I found difficult” section (reflection is valuable).

## Deliverables
- A draft Markdown report in the repo (rough is fine).
- At least 1 sample of generated text + short commentary.

## Stretch (Optional)
- Add a simple diagram (hand-drawn photo or ASCII) explaining one model.

## Reflection Questions
- What is the simplest explanation of “training” you can give?
- What’s one misconception someone might have about LLMs?
