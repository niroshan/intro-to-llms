# Session 12 — Finalize the Report and Publish

## Goal
Polish the report so it reads well, shows evidence, and clearly explains what was built and learned.

## Time
~1 hour

## Key Ideas
- Make it understandable, structured, and honest about limitations.
- Add links/citations for key claims (e.g., Transformer paper, basic LM definitions).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, the student can:
- Produce a final, readable report.
- Explain the full journey from N-grams → neural nets → RNN/LSTM → attention/Transformers.
- Publish the final write-up in the repo.

## Agenda (Suggested)
1. Proofread for clarity and structure.
2. Add figures/samples (generated text, loss curve if available).
3. Add a short “What I would do next” section.
4. Add citations/links (paper, tutorials, references).
5. Final pass: spelling, formatting, headings.

## Deliverables
- Final report Markdown file committed to the repo.
- A clean repo structure that makes it easy to browse sessions.

## Stretch (Optional)
- Create a simple landing README linking to each session folder.

## Reflection Questions
- What part of LLMs now feels less “magic”?
- If you had 10x more time, what would you build next?
